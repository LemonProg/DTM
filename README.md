# DTM
Discord-Torrents-Manager (DTM) is a vanilla javascript project to download and manage torrents from a discord server

Using : 
- Discord JS API to communicate throught the discord server
- Torrent-search API to search torrents on severals providers
- qBittorent API to download the torrents

Some issues :
- You can manage only one torrent (the last one that was imported), for the moment but i'll fix that too!
