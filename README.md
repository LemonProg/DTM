# DTM
Discord-Torrents-Manager (DTM) is a vanilla javascript project to download and manage torrents from a discord server

Using : 
- Discord JS API to communicate throught the discord server
- Torrent-search API to search torrents on severals providers
- qBittorent API to download the torrents

Only working with one result while searching for torrents, for the moment but i'll fix that !
